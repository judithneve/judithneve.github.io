# About me

I recently started a position as a wind energy data analyst for [Bitbloom](https://bitbloom.tech/). This was the result of a strong desire to play a part in addressing the climate crisis and my passion for statistics and data. I am interested in taking analyses end-to-end, from meeting with clients to identify their needs, to delivering high-quality, understandable, and actionable results.

Outside of work, I am a hobby crocheter, an amateur cook, and an occasional swordfighter.
