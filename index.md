# About me

I am a soon-to-be graduate (June 12th!) from [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en)'s Master's in [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences). My thesis focuses on hyperparameter tuning of random forests, which allowed me to delve deep into machine learning techniques this year. In parallel, I followed the [Applied Data Science track](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences/tracks), which gives me a breadth of knowledge regarding current data science and machine learning techniques, including, but not limited to, supervised and unsupervised learning, regularisation, deep learning and natural language processing.

Over the past two years, I have also done some teaching and consulting part-time. I developed course materials and gave statistics classes. I greatly enjoyed this, and would love my work to have a strong element of communication surrounding statistics - whether that is through listening to clients' needs and taking the rest in my own hands, working closely every step of the way to empower clients to do it themselves, or anything in between!

Prior to this, I graduated from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) with a joint honours Bachelor's in Psychology and Statistics. While I chose to move away for my Master's, I have always aimed to come back to Scotland - so that's where I'm looking for a job! I am open to work on location and remotely, what matters to me most is the purpose of my work - I aim to use my knowledge and abilities to help people or the climate.
