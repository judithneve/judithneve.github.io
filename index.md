# About me

I am a soon-to-be graduate (June 12th!) from [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en)'s Master's in [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences). My thesis focuses on hyperparameter tuning of random forests, which allowed me to delve deep into machine learning techniques this year. This is complemented by following the [Applied Data Science track](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences/tracks) as part of my electives, which gives me a breadth of knowledge regarding current data science and machine learning techniques, including, but not limited to, supervised and unsupervised learning, regularisatio, deep learning and natural language processing.

Prior to this, I graduated from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) with a joint honours Bachelor's in Psychology and Statistics, which is where my interest in interdisciplinarity and open science was sparked. While taking the step from my Bachelor's to my Master's was obvious, I'm now looking to work!

Over the past two years, I have done some teaching part-time, both in terms of developing course materials and giving classes. I greatly enjoyed this, and would love to continue communicating statistics - whether by explaining methods, findings, or possible research avenues - in the future.

I greatly value the impact my work and actions have, which is why I aim to use my knowledge and abilities to help people or the climate. [Get in touch](https://judithneve.github.io/contact.html) if you have an opportunity for me!
