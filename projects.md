# Projects

## Master's thesis: Evaluating tuning strategies for random forest hyperparameters with regards to prediction performance of clinical prediction models and computational time *(2022-2023)*

**Supervisors:** [Dr. Maarten van Smeden](http://mvansmeden.net/) \| Zo&euml; Dunias \| [Dr. Ben van Calster](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/ben-van-calster#tab-1)

Tuning models can take hours - but is it worth it? In this project, I decided to explore how different tuning strategies affect model predictive performance and whether longer, more exhaustive procedures pay off. I did so by programming three simulation studies in R, executed via slurm on a high-performance computer.

## Undergraduate dissertation: The evolution of data sharing practices in the psychological literature *(2020-2021)*

**Supervisor:** [Dr. Guillaume Rousselet](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/guillaumerousselet/)

This project focused on evaluating the rate at which data is shared and how it is shared over time. I combined data from three different sources and performed analyses in R. This study is being published in [Meta-Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/index)!

## Classification algorithm *(2023)*

I took part in a project aiming to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on a variety of visual characteristics. Multiple algorithms were used and compared.<br>

## Gibbs sampler *(2022)*

In order to deepen my understanding of Bayesian approaches, I have coded the entirety of a Gibbs sampler.<br>

## Online statistics lessons *(2022)*

I worked on making and updating online statistics lessons on the platform [Grasple](https://www.grasple.com/). These lessons are part of the general part of a mandatory [Advanced Research Methods and Statistics](https://osiris.uu.nl/osiris_student_uuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=201900104&collegejaar=2020&taal=en) course for psychology bachelor students.

## Testing CTmeta *(Oct. 2021-Apr. 2022)*

I worked as a research assistant for [Dr. Rebecca Kuiper](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RMKuiper). In that time, I extensively tested functions from the [CTmeta R package](https://rdrr.io/github/rebeccakuiper/CTmeta/) and edited the documentation.<br>

## \#TidyTuesdays *(2020)*

I have occasionally taken part in the [#TidyTuesdays](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges, which release a dataset each week and participants create visualisations.<br>

## Cards Against Humanity *(ongoing)*

In April 2020, after a fair few game nights with the people I was living with under lockdown, we started wondering whether a randomly added card in a [Cards Against Humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity) round was increasingly likely to win as the game went on. I took it upon myself to start collecting data to test this hypothesis - while my sample size is too small to draw meaningful conclusions so far, the project is ongoing and some visualisations do exist!
